# BACC: Born Accessible Content Checker

__BACC is an online tool for the automated checking of EPUB accessibility.__

## About BACC
You can use BACC to check whether your EPUB3 document meets the accessibility requirements of the following standards:
-	[EPUB Accessibility 1.0](http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html)
-	[WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/)
  
__Note:__ As only a limited number of accessibility requirements can be assessed automatically, it needs some further human-based accessibility testing to evaluate the total accessibility of an EPUB document.

## User Instruction
1.	To check the accessibility of one or more EPUB documents, *drag and drop* the files to the main page or *choose a file to upload*.
2.	The accessibility check will start automatically.
3.	After finishing the validation, BACC will provide an accessibility evaluation as well as a detailed report for each checked EPUB.

## Software Development
__At this time, BACC is still in a beta status.__  
The development of BACC takes place in the German Central Library for the Blind in Leipzig.  
For the validation of EPUB documents, BACC uses the accessibility checker *Ace*,  developed by the Daisy-Consortium, and extends it with some additional features:
-	As a __web application__, BACC can be used on every system __without any installation or maintenance effort__. 
-	The __graphic user interface__ allows a user-friendly operation.
-	The __drag & drop function__ enables the user to start the accessibility check easily and quickly.
-	BACC offers __batch processing__ to check several EPUB files at the same time.
-	The checker can be used either __in English or German language__.
