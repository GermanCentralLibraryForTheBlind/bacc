# baCC
Digital equality for all user has an important role in our society. Means people with print disabilities need the same access to information, especially books, like other users. So it is necessary to consider this from the beginning of production of digital content. This paradigma is called [“born accessible”](https://www.benetech.org/our-programs/literacy/born-accessible/). *if content is “born digital,” it can—and should—be “born accessible.”*
BaCC will try to help to achieve this digital equality. 

Today digital books are produced in [EPUB 3](http://idpf.org/epub/30). The baCC-tool will assist the eBook-EPUB3 production with focus on [Accessibility](http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility.html) requirements. It can check accessibility requirements automatically (not all) and so guarantee a base accessibility conformance.
